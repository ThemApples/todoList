# Issues

14/07/2022 - Icons not showing up on several buttons

14/07/2022 - Was not delete button Not working.
           - Resolved (The Math Function was not written correctly while I was following the Tutorial. As a result the elements did not have a proper id and was not able to be deleted.)

16/07/2022 - Drop Down menu was not filtering out proper elements in the array
           - Resolved (Forgot to add a onChange on the Form.js)

19/07/2022 - Icons now showing up. 
           - Manually added the react js icon packages
           - Reason for not using the whole packages is to reduce any additional storage wasted on storing icons not used.
